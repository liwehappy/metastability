I am currently on a self-directed journey of learning machine learning and project building. My main interests are machine learning, natural language processing, and physics.

## Background
Previously, I worked as software engineer at CAMEO Communication,Inc. and received a M.S. in plasma physics from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan.

## Reason behind building this wensite
With right attitude, discipline, and methods, I believe every data enthusiasts out there can learn data science and make impacts for our society without related education background. Thus, by building this platform, hopefully I can reach out to those who also wants to break into this field and facilitate their progress of learning.
