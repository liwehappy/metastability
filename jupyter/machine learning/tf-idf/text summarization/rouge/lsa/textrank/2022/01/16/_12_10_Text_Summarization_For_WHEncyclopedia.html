<p>Although being a well-rounded person is not an easy task, gaining more general knowledge outside of our professionals especially knowledge from world history sometimes could give us another perspective to perceive our world or have more empathy toward environments and people. By far the most effective way to be well-rounded person is by reading more books from a variety of genres. However, people nowadays can be distracted by their personal hardships and relatioships with others and therefore lack of time to read every book from beginning to end. As a result, we provide a life saver in this situation for anyone wants to learn some history from website <strong>World History Encyclopedia</strong>. In this notebook, we are going to further summarize these already abbreviated history articles from this website. This summarization will not only save your time from truely read the whole artilce but also quickly help you understand the whole articles (if you have time to read) by reading this summarization first.</p>

<pre>"Mulan (“magnolia”) is a legendary character in Chinese literature who is best known in the modern day from the Disney filmed adaptations (1998, 2020). Her story, however, about a young girl who takes her father's place in the army to help save her country, is hundreds of years old The tale most likely originated in the Northern Wei Period (386-535 CE) of China before it was developed by succeed... Ja Quan) which combines tai chi with dance, Kung Fu, and other arts to create a unique form of self-defense and personal improvement. The discipline is intended to encourage the confidence, strength, and grace of Mulan in modern-day practitioners and is only one of the many examples of how the legend of Mulan continues to inspire people today, especially women, just as it has done in the past.

<pre>Her story, however, about a young girl who takes her father's place in the army to help save her country, is hundreds of years old The tale most likely originated in the Northern Wei Period (386-535 CE) of China before it was developed by succeeding authors.
The play The Female Mulan (16th century CE) modifies earlier themes, moves the action back to the time of the Northern Wei, and introduces the happy ending of the marriage motif while succeeding versions conclude with Mulan killing herself to avoid the shame of having to become the emperor's concubine until the story returned the conclusion of the joyful family reunion and marriage.
The modern and ancient versions follow basically the same plot of a young girl who takes her aged father's place in the army when he is called to serve, performs her duties admirably, saves her country, and returns home to her family where she is received with honor.
In the Disney films, she is revealed as a woman but perseveres against the prohibition on females serving in the army to go beyond what is expected of her in defeating China's enemies; in the original version, where she serves 12 years, her gender is never questioned, and she only reveals herself at the end, much to the surprise of the men who served with her.
The original poem takes place during the chaotic era between the fall of the Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE) and the rise of the Sui Dynasty (589-618 CE) during which China first split into the Period of the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) and was then ruled by succeeding short-lived dynasties, one of which was the Wei, which established itself during the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589 CE).
The author's choice of this time period and this threat is intentional to appeal to the historically literate of his audience since, in 386 CE in Northern Wei, there was unrest caused by rebels and bandits of the south and the Kingdom of Northern Wei did actually issue a call to arms and conscription.
In the first act, she explains her situation, goes out and buys equipment, and then unbinds her feet (a practice which was unknown in the actual Northern Wei Period but would have been familiar to Xu Wei's audience) as the most telling detail of her transformation from female to male.
Hua Hu is thus sent home, still as a man, in the company of her two fellow soldiers, to await the new appointment…As she travels with the soldiers, they comment on how strange it is that they have never seen Hua Hu use the toilet [Hua Hu responds with an allusion to the moon goddess whose face frequently changes and true self is unknown]…Returning home, Hua Hu first reapplies female makeup, then greets her family.
The warrior woman Dou Xianniang also appears, combined with the “dark arts” aspect of The Story of the Loyal, Filial, and Heroic Mulan, to create an engaging character and the film works, drawing on many other aspects of the legend, to provide an audience with a new vision of the story instead of a simple remake of an earlier successful film.
Among these women is Xun Guan of the Western Jin Dynasty (265-316 CE), the 13-year-old daughter of governor Xun Song, who led a hand-picked team of soldiers to break the lines of the enemy forces surrounding her father's city and brought back a relief force to lift the siege.

<pre>Her story, however, about a young girl who takes her father's place in the army to help save her country, is hundreds of years old The tale most likely originated in the Northern Wei Period (386-535 CE) of China before it was developed by succeeding authors.
Scholarly consensus is that Mulan is a fictional character, probably developed in Northern China in response to the greater independence women enjoyed there, whose legend was then revised in succeeding eras to reflect the values and challenges of the times.
The original work, The Poem of Mulan, dates to the 6th century CE and reflects the influences of Mongolian-Turkic peoples on the region with a focus on filial piety the central virtue and moral of the tale.
By the time the character reached the modern era, through the film Mulan Joins the Army (1939), she was a staunch nationalist, driving out foreign invaders, and her earlier virtue of filial piety had been replaced by unwavering love for her country.
Since the appearance of the 1998 Disney animated film, Mulan's story has grown in popularity and drawn attention to the other women, all historically attested, who took up arms for a cause they believed in throughout China's history.
The story, as it is best known today through the recent films, places Mulan in an unidentified era of Imperial China (221 BCE - 1912 CE), but the original poem is set during the Northern Wei Period.
The modern and ancient versions follow basically the same plot of a young girl who takes her aged father's place in the army when he is called to serve, performs her duties admirably, saves her country, and returns home to her family where she is received with honor.
According to Shiamin and Idema, an opera Mu Lan Joins the Army was written in 1903 CE which sets the action in the Han Dynasty with the Xiongnu (a tribe of warriors often associated with the Huns) serving as the antagonists.
This version tells the same story but with typically Disney additions of a comical talking dragon, sentient cricket, and seemingly self-aware horse and retains the happy ending of the reunion of Mulan with her father and family and the suggestion that she will marry the handsome commander she served with.
The warrior woman Wong Cong'er (l. c. 1777-1798 CE) commanded the White Lotus Sect in the rebellion against the Qing Dynasty, leading an army of men and using guerilla tactics to achieve a number of significant victories.

<pre>The play The Female Mulan (16th century CE) modifies earlier themes, moves the action back to the time of the Northern Wei, and introduces the happy ending of the marriage motif while succeeding versions conclude with Mulan killing herself to avoid the shame of having to become the emperor's concubine until the story returned the conclusion of the joyful family reunion and marriage.
The story, as it is best known today through the recent films, places Mulan in an unidentified era of Imperial China (221 BCE - 1912 CE), but the original poem is set during the Northern Wei Period.
The original poem takes place during the chaotic era between the fall of the Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE) and the rise of the Sui Dynasty (589-618 CE) during which China first split into the Period of the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) and was then ruled by succeeding short-lived dynasties, one of which was the Wei, which established itself during the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589 CE).
There are no known versions of the Mulan story between the Tang Dynasty and the play The Female Mulan by the playwright Xu Wei (l. 1521-1593 CE) so it is assumed that Xu Wei drew on Guo Maoqian's work for his own.
In this version, Mulan is the daughter of a Turkish father and Chinese mother and, when the Turkish khan conscripts her father, Mulan goes in his place.
This same story is told, with significant differences, in The Story of the Loyal, Filial, and Heroic Mulan (also known as The Complete Account of Extraordinary Mulan, c. 1800 CE).
The Mulan legend was first featured on film in China in 1939 in Mulan Joins the Army which presented her as an ardent nationalist whose zeal for her country and heroism shames her male comrades throughout her tour of duty.
Mulan was featured, or alluded to, in other Chinese films afterwards but received international attention in 1998 with Disney's release of the animated feature film Mulan.
The warrior woman Dou Xianniang also appears, combined with the “dark arts” aspect of The Story of the Loyal, Filial, and Heroic Mulan, to create an engaging character and the film works, drawing on many other aspects of the legend, to provide an audience with a new vision of the story instead of a simple remake of an earlier successful film.
Mulan's story, and name, were also influential in the establishment of the martial art of Mulan Quan (also Mulan Hua Ja Quan) which combines tai chi with dance, Kung Fu, and other arts to create a unique form of self-defense and personal improvement.

 'The warrior woman Dou Xianniang also appears, combined with the “dark arts” aspect of The Story of the Loyal, Filial, and Heroic Mulan, to create an engaging character and the film works, drawing on many other aspects of the legend, to provide an audience with a new vision of the story instead of a simple remake of an earlier successful film.',
 "Mulan's story, and name, were also influential in the establishment of the martial art of Mulan Quan (also Mulan Hua Ja Quan) which combines tai chi with dance, Kung Fu, and other arts to create a unique form of self-defense and personal improvement."]</pre>

<p>ROUGE - Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a popular metrics for measuring the accuracy when dealing with langugage summarization or translation. Although ROUGE method can only measure syntactical matches rather than semantic similarities between words, it is still a very good tool at hand to handle summarization and machine translation tasks.</p>

<pre>Her story, however, about a young girl who takes her father's place in the army to help save her country, is hundreds of years old The tale most likely originated in the Northern Wei Period (386-535 CE) of China before it was developed by succeeding authors.
Scholarly consensus is that Mulan is a fictional character, probably developed in Northern China in response to the greater independence women enjoyed there, whose legend was then revised in succeeding eras to reflect the values and challenges of the times.
The original work, The Poem of Mulan, dates to the 6th century CE and reflects the influences of Mongolian-Turkic peoples on the region with a focus on filial piety the central virtue and moral of the tale.
By the time the character reached the modern era, through the film Mulan Joins the Army (1939), she was a staunch nationalist, driving out foreign invaders, and her earlier virtue of filial piety had been replaced by unwavering love for her country.
Since the appearance of the 1998 Disney animated film, Mulan's story has grown in popularity and drawn attention to the other women, all historically attested, who took up arms for a cause they believed in throughout China's history.
The story, as it is best known today through the recent films, places Mulan in an unidentified era of Imperial China (221 BCE - 1912 CE), but the original poem is set during the Northern Wei Period.
The modern and ancient versions follow basically the same plot of a young girl who takes her aged father's place in the army when he is called to serve, performs her duties admirably, saves her country, and returns home to her family where she is received with honor.
According to Shiamin and Idema, an opera Mu Lan Joins the Army was written in 1903 CE which sets the action in the Han Dynasty with the Xiongnu (a tribe of warriors often associated with the Huns) serving as the antagonists.
This version tells the same story but with typically Disney additions of a comical talking dragon, sentient cricket, and seemingly self-aware horse and retains the happy ending of the reunion of Mulan with her father and family and the suggestion that she will marry the handsome commander she served with.
The warrior woman Wong Cong'er (l. c. 1777-1798 CE) commanded the White Lotus Sect in the rebellion against the Qing Dynasty, leading an army of men and using guerilla tactics to achieve a number of significant victories.

<pre>Genghis Khan (aka Chinggis Khan) was the founder of the Mongol Empire which he ruled from 1206 until his death in 1227.
Born Temujin, he acquired the title of Genghis Khan, likely meaning 'universal ruler’, after unifying the Mongol tribes.
Genghis Khan had a fearsome reputation but he was an able administrator who introduced writing to the Mongols, created their first law code, promoted trade and granted religious freedom by permitting all religions to be freely practised anywhere in the Mongol world.
Temujin's mother was called Hoelun and his father, Yisugei, who was a tribal leader, and he arranged for his son to marry Borte (aka Bortei), the daughter of another influential Mongol leader, Dei-secen, but before this plan could come to fruition, Temujin's father was poisoned by a rival.
As his army swelled to ever greater proportions, Temujin defeated, over a period of ten years or so, such rivals as the Tartars, Kereyids, Naimans, and Merkids until a Mongol confederation met at a great conference or kurultai at the Kerulen river in 1206 and formally declared Temujin their leader.
He was given the title of Genghis Khan which likely means 'universal' leader (the spelling in Mongol is Chinggis but 'Genghis' remains more familiar today and derives from medieval Arab scholars not having a ch in their language).
The Jin State Genghis attacked the Jin state (aka Jurchen Jin Dynasty, 1115-1234) and the plain of the Yellow River in 1205, 1209, and 1211, the latter invasion consisting of two Mongol armies of 50,000 men each.
Rather short-sightedly, the fourth player in this game of empires, the Chinese Song Dynasty (aka Sung, 960 - 1279), instead of allying with the Jin to create a useful buffer zone between themselves and the Mongols, allied with the Khan.
1193), who made the following description of the Great Khan, by then already a legendary figure: A man of a tall stature, of vigorous build, robust in body, the hair on his face scanty and turned white, with cat's eyes, possessed of great energy, discernment, genius and understanding, awe-inspiring, a butcher, just, resolute, an overthrower of enemies, intrepid, sanguinary and cruel' (Tabakat-i Nasiri, c. 1260, quoted in Saunders, 63) Genghis Khan died on 18 August 1227 of an unknown illness, perhaps initially caused by falling from his horse while hunting a few months earlier.
At the time, he was back in northwest China besieging the Xia state's capital, Zhongxing, and the news of the great leader's death was kept from the Mongol army until the city had capitulated and its inhabitants been slaughtered.

<pre>European explorers began to probe the Western Hemisphere in the early 1500s, and they found to their utter amazement not only a huge landmass but also a world filled with several diverse and populous indigenous cultures.
Among their most important conquests were those of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean (1492-1502); Hernán Cortés in Aztec Mexico (1519-1521), Francisco Pizzaro and Diego de Almagro in Inca Peru (1528-1532), and Juan de Grijalva (1518) and Hernán Cortés (1519; 1524-1525) in Mayan Yucatán and Guatemala.
Following an earlier expedition through the Yucatán led by Juan de Grijalva, Hernán Cortés began his campaign against the Aztec Empire in 1519 and with his coalition army captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and the capital of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan in 1521.
It began when Francisco Pizarro, with his Andean allies captured and strangled Emperor Atahualpa in 1532, but it did not end for another 40 years until the last Inca stronghold of Vilcabamba (1500 m northeast of Cuzco) was conquered in 1572.
Following Cortés' conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Crown of Castile established the Kingdom of New Spain, which covered a huge area including what is now Mexico, much of the American Southwest in North America, Central America, northern parts of South America, and the Philippines.
The Spanish enforced this system of stratification through three institutions: When soldiers first encountered the native peoples, they were supposed to read aloud in Spanish the requerimiento, which told the natives they had to submit to the authority of the Spanish crown or face the sword.
Some have argued that haciendas evolved from the encomiendas, but in the haciendas system, land was granted to private individuals, but instead of the owners utilizing forced labor on these estates, free labor was recruited on a permanent or casual basis.
Because of the failure of most of the captaincies and the continued menace of French ships along the coast, King John III of Portugal (r. 1521-1557) decided in 1549 that he would have to colonize Brazil as a royal enterprise.
The Amerindians were confronted with an array of crops of which they had no experience and were left with insufficient time to grow their own crops while tending the fields of their masters or working in dank, dark mines.
There were at least 60 million people in North, Central, and South America before the first European contact in 1492, and by the 1600s probably 56 million had died, 90% of the whole pre-Columbian indigenous population.

<pre>From gift-giving to the sumptuous spread of a Christmas dinner table, this article traces the history of the celebrations from Roman times to the Victorian era when our modern take on the holiday was firmly established in both deed and literature.
Saturnalia was a week-long Roman festival held between the 17th and 23rd of December that honoured the agricultural god Saturn, nicely encompassing the winter solstice, another event of significance in the pagan calendar.
For the rich, fine clothes and jewellery were the norm; for the less well-off, nicer food than usual, a bundle of firewood or simple wooden toys like spinning tops and dolls were eagerly anticipated.
The tradition of giving gifts on the 1st January remained strong, and this included Elizabeth I of England herself, who regularly received jewels, extravagant dresses, and feather fans from her courtiers.
With no public roads, travelling by horse and carriage was slow and uncomfortable; nevertheless, the more intrepid could visit sights like Francis Drake's Golden Hind ship in London, which had made the first English circumnavigation of the globe (1577 to 1580).
The Victorians certainly ensured that such medieval elements as a Christmas morning church service, feasting, games, gifts, and pantomimes continued to enjoy their status as essential activities of the season.
The young fir tree was decorated with candles and small presents (toys, sweets, charms, and candied fruit) hung from its boughs that were destined to be distributed to the Christmas guests who might have their name tagged to their gift.
A more efficient postage system and the introduction of the Penny Black stamp in 1840 meant that correspondence increased and a tradition developed of sending friends and distant family a Christmas card, first introduced in England in 1843.
The jolly figure with the long white beard who visits homes on Christmas Eve to leave good children presents has his origins in the 4th-century Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra in Anatolia who delighted in distributing gifts, including sacks of gold.
Nowadays, electric lights may have replaced the candles on the tree, churches are not quite as busy as they used to be, the Yule log is now usually chocolate, and many of the cards have become electronic, but the traditions that have run through the centuries to celebrate Christmas Day continue each and every year to enchant and inspire as they have always done.

   "The poor enjoyed more modest entertainment like cards and dice, carols, playing musical instruments, board games, telling folktales, and enjoying traditional party games like permitting one person to be the 'king of the feast' if they found a bean in the special bread or cake – everyone else then had to mimic the 'king' (a role-reversal game that echoed Saturnalia's similar 'Lord of Misrule').",
