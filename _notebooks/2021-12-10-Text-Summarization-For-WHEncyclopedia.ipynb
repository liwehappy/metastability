By far the most effective way to be well-rounded person is by reading more books from a variety of genres. However, people nowadays can be distracted by their personal hardships and relatioships with others and therefore lack of time to read every book from beginning to end. As a result, we provide a life saver in this situation for anyone wants to learn some history from website **World History Encyclopedia**. In this notebook, we are going to further summarize these already abbreviated history articles from this website.

            "In the first act, she explains her situation, goes out and buys equipment, and then unbinds her feet (a practice which was unknown in the actual Northern Wei Period but would have been familiar to Xu Wei's audience) as the most telling detail of her transformation from female to male.\n",

            "The warrior woman Dou Xianniang also appears, combined with the “dark arts” aspect of The Story of the Loyal, Filial, and Heroic Mulan, to create an engaging character and the film works, drawing on many other aspects of the legend, to provide an audience with a new vision of the story instead of a simple remake of an earlier successful film.\n",
